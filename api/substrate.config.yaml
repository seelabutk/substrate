### Define the service
service_name:
  internalPort: REQUIRED - the internal port used to access the service
  ### Define the data source
  data:
    source: REQUIRED - a list of paths or URLs pointing to the data to use
      - /path/to/data
      - /path/to/data/dataset.dat
      - https://data.com/dataset.dat

    image: REQIURED - the docker image of the service that will run when the service is started
    port: OPTIONAL - the port to be expose the Docker service on
    replicas: OPTIONAL - the number of replicas the Docker swarm should use
    advertise_addr: REQUIRED if using multiple local nodes - the IP:PORT to use to add nodes to the swarm
    managers: OPTIONAL - Addresses of nodes that should be added to the swarm as managers
      - manager2.com
      - ip.of.manager.3
    workers: OPTIONAL - Addresses of nodes that should be added to the swarm as workers
      - ip.of.worker.1
      - worker2.ai
      - ip.of.worker.3


  ### AWS deployment
  aws:
    ami: REQUIRED if you don't have access to SSM - the ID of the Amazon Machine Image to use
    service_command: REQUIRED - the service command to use when running on AWS
    https: OPTIONAL (default: false) - should the container deploy an Application Load Balancer in front of the EC2 instance? You will need to add your own SSL cert to the balancer before HTTPS will work.

    role_arn: REQUIRED if you don't have access to create IAM roles - the role ARN of the IAM role you want to use to deploy
    save_logs: OPTIONAL (default: true) - sync the EC2 leader's cloud-init logs to S3 after each command
    managers: REQUIRED - list of the type and count of EC2 instances to use as managers
      't3.micro': 1
    workers: OPTIONAL - list of the type and count of EC2 instances to use as workers
      't3.micro': 3

### Tool specific settings (TODO: figure out how to make this work with generic tool)
